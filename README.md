## X Education
### Problem Statement:
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.

Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Problem Statement 2
X Education has a period of 2 months every year during which they hire some interns. The sales team, in particular, has around 10 interns allotted to them. So during this phase, they wish to make the lead conversion more aggressive. So they want almost all of the potential leads (i.e. the customers who have been predicted as 1 by the model) to be converted and hence, want to make phone calls to as much of such people as possible. Suggest a good strategy they should employ at this stage.

### Problem Statement 3
Similarly, at times, the company reaches its target for a quarter before the deadline. During this time, the company wants the sales team to focus on some new work as well. So during this time, the company’s aim is to not make phone calls unless it’s extremely necessary, i.e. they want to minimize the rate of useless phone calls. Suggest a strategy they should employ at this stage.
